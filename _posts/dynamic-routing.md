There are a couple of things that you want to consider when starting a personal project. 
I collected 5 things from my personal experience so I hope you can learn from my mistakes.

## Choose a project idea that you are passionate about
No matter what you like more cats or dogs, reading books or watching movies you should choose your project based on your personal preferences. 

## Don't follow blindly tutorial from the Internet

## Set small reachable goals

Setting small goals is the best way to let you enjoy the process constantly. When you set goals for yourself and can reach them in a couple of hours,
you have a very rewarding experience. For example, you want to build a blog. You start by doing your research and deciding what set of tools you will use and
that is your very first goal accomplished. Next you look into how other people design their web site and you sketch a draft either on paper or tool like Figma and this is already your second deliverable. When you work on the page each separate page and functionality like a like button is a separate deliverable. In this way you always have these small things that you can add and improve your web site. Ideally, you should set up yourself a light tracking tool like Trello Board or even a simple notebook. Just adding yourself a task and moving it to done feels very satisfiyng (trust me on that!). And if you want to get to the project later you can rewind the decisions you did and why it works like that. You will definetely forget all the details in your project in just a few weeks.


## Decide what would be a Minimal Viable Product for you

Put the most necessary things and deliver your project as an MVP. MVP will make you stay focused and deliver something that is usable and that you can showcase. Once you are done with that you can do what you like, but now you have some kind of a baseline at least.

## Once you decide on tools and technologies you use resist the tension to switch to the next shining new tool

This is especially true, if you are JS developer as you can see a new framework being born every day. But before you jump on the hype train, ask yourself the following questions: Why did you start doing your project with the current tools? Where you trying to get some experience in them before you can apply for work? If the answer is yes, than will this new shiny tool help you to achieve that? The answer here is usually no.
